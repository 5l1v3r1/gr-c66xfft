The goal of this project is to build GNU Radio blocks that implement
an FFT and FFT filter that uses OpenCL to offload the processing to
the C66x DSPs on the BeagleBoard-X15 Texas Instruments AM5728 processor.
Note that these blocks are for demonstration only and perform much worse
than FFTW running on the AM5728 ARM Cortex-A15 processor.

In order to run GNU Radio Companion as non-root, the following changes
are required:

1) sudo setcap cap_sys_rawio+ep /usr/bin/python2.7

2) Edit /etc/init.d/ti-ipc-dra7xx and change the line:

tiipclad_params="-g -l lad.txt"

to:

tiipclad_params="-l lad.txt -p 777".

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Contributions are welcome!
